            Hungry Ben was established on May 28, 2020. There was a story behind
            its business name “Hungry Ben,” it was formed by the big dream of a
            man who later became a business owner. According to the owner, he
            enjoys eating different types of food in several countries and
            places. When he does not do anything, he feels hungry. Therefore, he
            called himself ‘Hungry Ben.’
          </p>
          <p class="about-text">
            Hungry Ben was formed with high desire and dreams that once seemed
            impossible but became attainable. Hungry Ben’s main product is
            Burger which provides a unique taste of burger patty that is made
            from pure beef. At first, there were no people buying from this
            store because no one knew the family owner, but when people tasted
            their products, it became more recognized in the market industry
            even its new product released including Corndog.
